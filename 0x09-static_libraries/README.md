# 0x09. C - Static Libraries

## Description

**This project is about creating and using static libraries in C.** You will learn how to create a static library from a collection of object files, and how to link a static library into your own program.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn to:

* Create a static library from a collection of object files.
* Link a static library into your own program.
* Understand the difference between static and shared libraries.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Create a Static Library

**Create a static library called `my_lib.a` that contains the following functions:**

* `int add(int a, int b)`
* `int subtract(int a, int b)`
* `int multiply(int a, int b)`
* `int divide(int a, int b)`

### Task 1: Use a Static Library

**Write a program that uses the `my_lib.a` library to add two numbers together.**

### Task 2: Create a Shared Library

**Create a shared library called `my_lib.so` that contains the same functions as the `my_lib.a` library.**

### Task 3: Use a Shared Library

**Write a program that uses the `my_lib.so` library to add two numbers together.**
