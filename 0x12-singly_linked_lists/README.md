# C Singly Linked Lists

This directory contains C source code files related to singly linked lists.

## File List

- `0-print_list.c`: A program that prints the elements of a linked list.
- `1-list_len.c`: A program that calculates the length of a linked list.
- `100-first.c`: A program that demonstrates the use of the `constructor` attribute in C.
- `101-hello_school.asm`: An assembly program that prints "Hello, School!".
- `2-add_node.c`: A program that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
- `3-add_node_end.c`: A program that adds a new node at the end of a linked list.
- `4-free_list.c`: A program that frees the memory of a linked list.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the directory and its contents.
- `lists.h`: A header file containing function prototypes and structure definitions.

## Usage

To compile and run the programs, you can use a C compiler such as `gcc`. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -o print_list 0-print_list.c
./print_list

## About
These programs are meant to demonstrate concepts related to singly linked lists in C programming. Feel free to explore the source code to understand how each program works.
