# General

This section covers key concepts in C programming, including working with program arguments, different `main` function prototypes, and techniques to handle unused variables or parameters using `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)`.

## Utilizing Program Arguments

When executing a C program, you can provide command-line arguments that the program can access. These arguments are stored in the `argv` array, while the total count is stored in `argc`. You can access and utilize these arguments based on the requirements of your program.

## `main` Function Prototypes

The `main` function, the entry point of a C program, can have two primary prototypes:

1. `int main(void)`
2. `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`

The choice between these prototypes depends on whether your program expects command-line arguments. The first version suits programs without arguments, while the second version facilitates those with command-line inputs.

## Suppressing Unused Variable Warnings

Unused variables or parameters in functions can trigger warnings during compilation. To prevent this, consider using `__attribute__((unused))` or casting the variable to `(void)`:

Example using `__attribute__((unused))`:

```c
void example_function(int unused_variable) __attribute__((unused));
void example_function(int unused_variable) {
    // Code without using unused_variable
}
