# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

## Description

In this project, you will learn about how to use arguments passed to your C program, explore different prototypes of the `main` function, and discover techniques to handle unused variables or parameters using `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)`.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand how to access and utilize command-line arguments passed to your program.
- Identify and differentiate between the two main prototypes of the `main` function and know when to use each.
- Utilize `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to prevent warnings when compiling functions with unused variables or parameters.

### Task 2: The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter
