# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

## Description

**This project is about dynamic memory allocation in C.** You will learn how to allocate memory using the `malloc()` and `free()` functions, and how to avoid memory leaks.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn to:

* Allocate memory using the `malloc()` function.
* Free memory using the `free()` function.
* Avoid memory leaks.

## Tasks

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| [Task 0](./0-allocate_memory.c): Allocate Memory | Write a program that allocates memory for an integer and prints the value of the integer. |
| [Task 1](./1-free_memory.c): Free Memory | Write a program that allocates memory for an integer and then frees the memory. |
| [Task 2](./2-avoid_memory_leaks.c): Avoid Memory Leaks | Write a program that allocates memory for an integer and then prints the value of the integer. Make sure to free the memory to avoid a memory leak. |
| [Task 3](./3-allocate_and_free_array_of_integers.c): Allocate and Free an Array of Integers | Write a program that allocates memory for an array of integers and then prints the values of the integers in the array. |
| [Task 4](./4-allocate_and_free_2d_array_of_integers.c): Allocate and Free a 2D Array of Integers | Write a program that allocates memory for a 2D array of integers and then prints the values of the integers in the array. |
