# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

## Description

**This project is about more dynamic memory allocation in C.** You will learn how to use the `malloc()` and `free()` functions with different types of data, and how to handle errors.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn to:

* Use the `malloc()` and `free()` functions with different types of data.
* Handle errors that occur when allocating or freeing memory.

## Tasks

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| [Task 0](./0-malloc_checked.c): Allocate Memory with Error Checking | Write a program that allocates memory for an integer and prints the value of the integer. Make sure to check for errors that may occur when allocating memory. |
| [Task 1](./1-string_malloc.c): Allocate Memory for a String | Write a program that allocates memory for a string and then prints the string. |
| [Task 2](./2-array_of_strings_malloc.c): Allocate Memory for an Array of Strings | Write a program that allocates memory for an array of strings and then prints the strings in the array. |
| [Task 3](./3-struct_malloc.c): Allocate Memory for a Structure | Write a program that allocates memory for a structure and then prints the values of the members of the structure. |
| [Task 4](./4-multiple_free.c): Free Multiple Memory Blocks | Write a program that allocates multiple memory blocks and then frees them all. |
